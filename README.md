# First class project -- GroupWiki

    First project in version control class.
  
   This is our first project of the quarter. Our team is made up of 4 students who each have individual roles along with each team member being responsible 
  for creating their own page on the topic. We were presented with 9 choices for topic and we as a team chose the topic of Artificial Intelligence. This project will give
  us a chance to work on our BASIC github skills, work in a team environment and write about a fascinating topic to boot. Without further ado lets introduce
  the members of our team and their roles.
 
 ##  Abu: Team lead.
 
 ##  Austin: Research Lead.
 
 ##  Hyu: Editor.
 
 ##  Daniel: Wiki Owner.
